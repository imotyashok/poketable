    <h1>Welcome to Poke-Table!</h1>
    <p>One of the most important tools that a chemist has at
        their disposal is a periodic table. Unfortunately, 
        regular periodic tables are quite boring to look at.<br />
        Enjoy this version of the periodic table where the 
        elements have been reimagined into pokemon-like creatures!<p>
